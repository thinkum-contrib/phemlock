                          INSTALLATION NOTES

Phemlock comes with a mk:defsystem style .system file. So when you are
lucky you just can fire up your Lisp and say

    (oos :hemlock :load)

    (cl-user::hemlock)

If you want to try the CLIM backend, which not yet is fully operational, try:

    (clim-hemlock::clim-hemlock)


This was tested with:

 - CMUCL
 - ACL
 - CLISP using MIT CLX


ASDF system file hemlock.asd has been added, supporting SBCL for now.

;;; Bitmap line-buffered support.

;;; UPDATE-BITMAP-LINE-BUFFERED-STREAM is called when anything is written to
;;; a line-buffered-random-typeout-stream on the bitmap.  It does a lot of
;;; checking to make sure that strings of characters longer than the width of
;;; the window don't screw us.  The code is a little wierd, so a brief
;;; explanation is below.
;;;
;;; The more-mark is how we tell when we will next need to more.  Each time
;;; we do a more-prompt, we point the mark at the last visible character in
;;; the random typeout window.  That way, when the mark is no longer
;;; DISPLAYED-P, we know it's time to do another more prompt.
;;;
;;; If the buffer-end-mark is DISPLAYED-P, then we return, only redisplaying
;;; if there was at least one newline in the last batch of output.  If we
;;; haven't done a more prompt yet (indicated by a value of T for
;;; first-more-p), then since we know the end of the buffer isn't visible, we
;;; need to do a more-prompt.  If neither of the first two tests returns T,
;;; then we can only need to do a more-prompt if our more-mark has scrolled
;;; off the top of the screen.  If it hasn't, everything is peechy-keen, so
;;; we scroll the screen one line and redisplay.

;;; must be empty, and BUFFER-END-MARK must be on this line.  The final test is
;;; that the window-end is displayed within the window.  If it is not, then the
;;; last line wraps past the end of the window, and there is text past the
;;; bottom.

HEMLOCK AS A GADGET

I want Hemlock as a gadget for McCLIM. The easiest route to get that is to
have a hemlock run in another thread and pass input events in as the gadget
receives them. Redisplay should be done though accessing the dis-lines of
Hemlock's idea of the window. When arguments are asked for in the echo
buffer, pop up a little window near the cursor and ask there. [could also
been done in real Hemlock]. When we run Hemlock as a gadget disallow
changing windows or changing buffers.
